# PSDscResources

PSDscResources is the new home of the in-box resources from PSDesiredStateConfiguration.

These resources are a combination of those in the in-box PSDesiredStateConfiguration module as well as community contributions from our experimental [xPSDesiredStateConfiguration](https://github.com/PowerShell/xPSDesiredStateConfiguration) module on GitHub.
These resources have also recently been updated to meet the DSC Resource Kit [High Quality Resource Module (HQRM) guidelines](https://github.com/PowerShell/DscResources/blob/master/HighQualityModuleGuidelines.md).

In-box resources not currently included in this module should not be affected and can still load from the in-box PSDesiredStateConfiguration module.

Because PSDscResources overwrites in-box resources, it is only available for WMF 5.1.
Many of the resource updates provided here are also included in the [xPSDesiredStateConfiguration](https://github.com/PowerShell/xPSDesiredStateConfiguration) module which is still compatible with WMF 4 and WMF 5 (though this module is not supported and may be removed in the future).

To update your in-box resources to the newest versions provided by PSDscResources, first install PSDscResources from the PowerShell Gallery:
```powershell
Install-Module PSDscResources
```

Then, simply add this line to your DSC configuration:
```powershell
Import-DscResource -ModuleName PSDscResources
```

* Ported fixes from [xPSDesiredStateConfiguration](https://github.com/PowerShell/xPSDesiredStateConfiguration):
    * WindowsProcess: Minor updates to integration tests
    * Registry: Fixed support for forward slashes in registry key names
* Group:
    * Group members in the "NT Authority", "BuiltIn" and "NT Service" scopes should now be resolved without an error. If you were seeing the errors "Exception calling ".ctor" with "4" argument(s): "Server names cannot contain a space character."" or "Exception calling ".ctor" with "2" argument(s): "Server names cannot contain a space character."", this fix should resolve those errors. If you are still seeing one of the errors, there is probably another local scope we need to add. Please let us know.
