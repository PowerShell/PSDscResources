# PSDscResources

PSDscResources is the new home of the in-box resources from PSDesiredStateConfiguration.

These resources are a combination of those in the in-box PSDesiredStateConfiguration module as well as community contributions from our experimental [xPSDesiredStateConfiguration](https://github.com/PowerShell/xPSDesiredStateConfiguration) module on GitHub.
These resources have also recently been updated to meet the DSC Resource Kit [High Quality Resource Module (HQRM) guidelines](https://github.com/PowerShell/DscResources/blob/master/HighQualityModuleGuidelines.md).

In-box resources not currently included in this module should not be affected and can still load from the in-box PSDesiredStateConfiguration module.

Because PSDscResources overwrites in-box resources, it is only available for WMF 5.1.
Many of the resource updates provided here are also included in the [xPSDesiredStateConfiguration](https://github.com/PowerShell/xPSDesiredStateConfiguration) module which is still compatible with WMF 4 and WMF 5 (though this module is not supported and may be removed in the future).

To update your in-box resources to the newest versions provided by PSDscResources, first install PSDscResources from the PowerShell Gallery:
```powershell
Install-Module PSDscResources
```

Then, simply add this line to your DSC configuration:
```powershell
Import-DscResource -ModuleName PSDscResources
```

#### Requirements

None

#### Parameters

* **[String] GroupName** _(Key)_: The name of the group to create, modify, or remove.
